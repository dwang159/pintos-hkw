>> A2: What is the maximum size of a file supported by your inode

Let b = BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE = 512 for convenience.

Direct:
We have 12 direct blocks = 12 * 512 = 6144 bytes

Indirect:
We have b / 4 indirect blocks = 128 * 512 = 65536 bytes

Doubly indirect addressing:
We have (b / 4)^2 doubly indirect blocks = 128^2 * 512 = 8,388,608 bytes

Triply indirect addressing:
Not implemented.

So in total, the maximum file size supported is 8,460,288 bytes = 8.4MB.

My inode structure is very similar to that of an inode used in the ext2
filesystem. We have 12 direct-level blocks, 1 set of indirect blocks, and 1 set
of doubly-indirect blocks. The total number of blocks is 15 (we chose to not
implement triply-indirect blocks, which is the 15th slot), which is the number
used by ext2 (changing this number, defined as N_BLOCKS, only changes the
number of direct blocks). We wanted to maximize the number of direct blocks
available, so that small files will have better performance by requiring fewer
lookups to access data. By having one set of indirect and one set of doubly
indirect blocks, we had enough blocks available to cover the maximum size of
files supported by pointos (8MB), so there was no need to have more than one of
each (or to have triply-indirect blocks).

			    SUBDIRECTORIES

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or

struct dir {
    struct lock dlock; // Lock for creation/deletion of files in directories

struct thread {
    // Current directory inode
    struct inode *dir;

struct inode_disk {
    ...
    // Whether this inode is a directory
    bool is_dir;

    // If this inode is a directory, represents the parent directory.
    // Invalid for files due to hard linking
    block_sector_t parent;
}

struct inode {
    // whether this inode is a directory
    bool is_dir;
}

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: Describe your code for traversing a user-specified path.  How
>> do traversals of absolute and relative paths differ?
We begin by determining whether we have been given an absolute or relative
path. This is done by checking whether the given path name starts with the
character '/'. If it does, we open the root directory. Otherwise, we open
the current working directory. We then tokenize the path, separating on
'/' characters. We use dir_lookup on the current open directory to determine
which directory to open next. If this is NULL, the path does not exist, and
we free our resources and return NULL. Otherwise, we open the directory
that we just looked up and close the old one. If we find that we have
reached the second to last token, we set our current directory back to our
old directory before proceeding, ensuring that we have opened the second-to-
last, rather than last, directory.
Here, the only difference between absolute and relative paths is the starting
point for our current open directory. We deal with "." and ".." by entering
them as entries upon creation of each directory. They can then be treated
like any other directory when looking up a path.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B4: How do you prevent races on directory entries?  For example,
>> only one of two simultaneous attempts to remove a single file
>> should succeed, as should only one of two simultaneous attempts to
>> create a file with the same name, and so on.
Inside of the dir struct, we keep a lock. We acquire this lock before
we lookup to determine whether a name is valid, then after we try
to add or remove a file. This ensures that after we determine a name
is valid, we can't switch to another thread that may also determine
it to be valid. That is, we group together validating a name and
writing/removing from the directory. This way, if two creations
of the same name are attempted, the first will succeed, and the second
will determine that the name is invalid. If two removals occur, the
same thing will happen; one will succeed, and the other will detect
an invalid name.

>> B5: Does your implementation allow a directory to be removed if it

We allow a directory to be removed, but keep track of it in the
is_removed field of its inode. If this is set, we disallow future
interactions with the directory.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B6: Explain why you chose to represent the current directory of a
>> process the way you did.
We represent the current directory of a process with an inode pointer.
This allows us to keep information stored in the inode such as whether
the directory has been removed, and also allows us to freely convert
between dir structs and disk_inodes. Because we can store this
additional information and convert to any other structure if needed,
an inode * appears to be an ideal candidate for representing the cwd.
